# Q-SYS Api Types

A set of EmmyLua type definitions for the Q-SYS type Lua API.

## Usage

The primary way is probably to download from the releases section on GitHub.

Or install via npm:

```
npm install -S qsys-api-types
```

`npm` has the added benefit of having a matching SemVer concept. As the QSYS API changes, we can update our releases of this module in-line so that you can always find the release that matches the version you're programming for. (We aren't matching the Q-SYS semver release numbers... yet)
